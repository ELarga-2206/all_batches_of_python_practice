# Create a program that ask user to input a number, continue asking until the user input is invalid. Display the average.

#average
# user inputs + user inputs / no of user inputs
# must have counter of user inputs
# must add the number to the list and update the total sum

# counter = 0
#while loop
#user input
#append valid inputs, then add their values
#once added should be divided to total of inputs (valid numbers only, no alphabet)
